Agreeable people also have an optimistic view of human\nnature. They believe people are basically honest, decent, and\ntrustworthy. Disagreeable individuals place self-interest above getting along with\nothers.  They are generally unconcerned with others' well-being, and\ntherefore are unlikely to extend themselves for other people.\nSometimes their skepticism about others' motives causes them to be\nsuspicious, unfriendly, and uncooperative.\nAgreeableness is obviously advantageous for attaining and maintaining\npopularity. Agreeable people are better liked than disagreeable\npeople. On the other hand, agreeableness is not useful in situations\nthat require tough or absolute objective decisions. Disagreeable\npeople can make excellent scientists, critics, or soldiers.",

They tend to be enthusiastic,\naction-oriented, individuals who are likely to say \"Yes!\" or \"Let's\ngo!\" to opportunities for excitement. In groups they like to talk,\nassert themselves, and draw attention to themselves.\n\nIntroverts lack the exuberance, energy, and activity levels of\nextraverts. They tend to be quiet, low-key, deliberate, and\ndisengaged from the social world. Their lack of social involvement\nshould not be interpreted as shyness or depression; the\nintrovert simply needs less stimulation than an extravert and prefers\nto be alone. The independence and reserve of the introvert is\nsometimes mistaken as unfriendliness or arrogance. In reality, an\nintrovert who scores high on the agreeableness dimension will not\nseek others out but will be quite pleasant when approached.",
